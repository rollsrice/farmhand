Helpers for FarmRPG

## How to use
1. Type `about:debugging` in address bar
2. Click "This Firefox"
3. Update the `maxInventory` variable to whatever you have
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." and select `manifest.json`
5. Tap "Update Inventory" button when on your inventory page to sync inventory counts

Tap "Update Inventory" regularly

## Notes
* Tested on Firefox 92.0.1 (not tested on Chrome or any other browser)
* Colors hardcoded for Dark Mode for now
* Only updates item count when exploring (pet collection, farm item generation doesn't apply), you'll need to Update Inventory each time to sync
* Code is not optimized
